# CSVtoJsonString
This code shows how to convert a csv file to json string

Steps to execute in your local machine. 

1. Create a Java project. You can use whichever way you want to create a maven java project. The simplest way I use is, by using IntelliJ ( I have community edition). File-> Create New -> Maven Project -> ArcheType maven-archetype-quickstart.
2. Once project is created, you should see pom.xml and a quick start app.java file.
3. Then manually copy paste the contents of this project.

Or Simply import this project into your IntelliJ (Pun intented ;-) )
